<h2 style="text-align: center;">HOW TO STAY SAFE ONLINE</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Create Complex Passwords</span></h3>
creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajm-AZODyn4"><u>strong, unique passwords</u></a> for all your critical accounts really is the best way to keep your personal and financial information safe.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"> Boost Your Network Security</span></h3>
When at home or work, you probably use a password-protected router that encrypts your data. But, when you’re on the road, you might be tempted to use free, public Wi-Fi.The problem with public Wi-Fi is that it is often unsecured. This means it’s relatively easy for a hacker to access your device or information
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Use a Firewall</span></h3>
This an electronic barrier that blocks unauthorized access to your computers and devices, and is often included with comprehensive security software. Using a firewall ensures that all of the devices connected to your network are secured, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices like smart thermostats and webcams
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"> Be a Selective Sharer</span></h3>
These days, there are a lot of opportunities to share our personal information online. Just be cautious about what you share, particularly when it comes to your identity information
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> <span style="color: #ff6600;">Protect Your Mobile Life</span></h3>
Our mobile devices can be just as vulnerable to online threats as our laptops. In fact, mobile devices face new risks, such as risky apps and dangerous links sent by text message. Be careful where you click, don’t respond to messages from strangers, and only download apps from official app stores after reading other users’ reviews first
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Keep up to date</span></h3>
Keep all your software updated so you have the latest security patches. Turn on automatic updates so you don’t have to think about it, and make sure that your security software is set to run regular scans
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Lookout for the latest scams </span></h3>
Currently, <strong><b>“</b></strong>ransomware<strong><b>” </b></strong>is on the rise. This is when a hacker threatens to lock you out of all of your files unless you agree to pay a ransom
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"> Practice Safe Surfing &amp; Shopping</span></h3>
When shopping online, or visiting websites for online banking or other sensitive transactions, always make sure that the site’s address starts with “https”, instead of just “http”, and has a padlock icon in the URL field. This indicates that the website is secure and uses encryption to scramble your data so it can’t be intercepted by others

<h2 style="text-align: center;">How To DETERMINE A WEBSITE IS FRAUD , SCAM OR FAKE:</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Pay Close Attention to the URL </span></h3>
You would be absolutely shocked how many people pay little to no attention to the address bar of their browser. This is a huge mistake. The address bar contains a ton of vital information about where you are and how secure you are there
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Check Connection Security Indicators </span></h3>
The internet was built on HTTP, or the hypertext transfer protocol. When HTTP was first defined the internet was not used for commercial activity. In fact, commercial activity on the internet was actually illegal at the time. The internet was primarily supposed to be a platform for the free exchange of information between academia and the government. Any communication done via HTTP is sent in plaintext and can be intercepted, manipulated, stolen.
